# Power BI Sales insights Project

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard to analyze sales data from January 2024. The dataset includes information on sales revenue, quantity sold, and regions for different products.

Key fields in the dataset are:

**Date Sold**: The date of each sale.
**Product**: The product sold (Product A, Product B, Product C, Product D).
**Sales**: The revenue generated from each sale.
**Quantity**: The number of units sold.
**Region**: The region where the sale occurred (North, East, West).

The goal is to use this data to gain insights into sales performance and identify trends across different regions and products.
